# Federated Learning for distributed databases

Based on [fl-official-statistcs](https://github.com/joshua-stock/fl-official-statistics) this repo investigates further the feasability of Federated Learning for Official Statistics.

## Setup

more possible environment (e.g. local, R-Server) tba.

### Google Colab

Required:

- google account with ...
- connected google colab
- activated google drive

Open a new notebook in Google Colab. This starts a new session (called runtime) with nothing installed or available in memory. S. [How to use Google Colaboratory to clone a GitHub Repository to your Google Drive? (Medium)](https://medium.com/@ashwindesilva/how-to-use-google-colaboratory-to-clone-a-github-repository-e07cf8d3d22b).

#### Pull repo

```python
from google.colab import drive

# connect gdrive and the current runtime of colab
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
%cd gdrive/My Drive

# clone
!git clone https://github.com/Olhaau/fl-official-statistics-addon
# the repo gets cloned to gdrive and available in the current runtime 
%cd fl-official-statistics-addon

# pull (the currenct version of the repo)
!git pull
```

#### Push changes

After you have made changes to your notebook, you can commit and push them to the repository. To do so from within a Colab notebook, click File → Save a copy in GitHub. You will be prompted to add a commit message, and after you click OK, the notebook will be pushed to your repository (s. https://bebi103a.github.io/lessons/02/git_with_colab.html). 

For possible solutions from within a notebook s. [stackoverflow/how-to-push-from-colab-to-github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59454990/how-to-push-from-colab-to-github)

## Repo Structure

### _dev

### archive

### original_work

This folder contains the original repository. It is divided into three main parts. These can be found in the contained top folders.

#### PM2.5 prediction for Beijing

The pm-beijing folder contains data with weather and air pollution data and can be used to predict the PM2.5 concentration in the air. The folder contains the following subfolders and files:
* data: The pm25 beijing dataset
* models: The trained models are saved here, it contains already trained models
* tensorboard-logs: The log files used by tensorboard
* pm25_beijing.py: The python module containing all the functions used in the notebooks
* pm25_central_model.ipynb: The single model, trained on all the data
* pm25_cross_validation.ipynb: The above model but trained with cross validation
* pm25_feature_comparison.ipynb: A simple model to compare how time and wind direction affect the prediction
* pm25_federated.ipynb: A federated model for PM2.5 prediction
* pm25_federated_cross_val.ipynb: The above federated model with cross validation
* pm25_hyperparametersearch.ipynb: A hyperparametersearch for optimising the model
* pm25_local_models.ipynb: A local model for each station is trained here

#### LTE data from Umlaut

This folder contains everything related to Umlaut and their data. As the original data from Umlaut is not accessible it contains only short dummy data to test the models.
* data: The data files, both files hold the same kind of information, however be aware that the name of the features differ slightly
* lte_federated.ipynb: The federated model for the LTE data and centralised models for comparison reasons
* lte_hyperparametersearch.ipynb: A hyperparametersearch for different models
* umlaut_lte.py: A python module containing some functions used by the notebooks

#### Medical insurance data

Everything concerning the medical insurance data is stored here. This dataset is used to calculate charges a person has to pay and contains data as age, sex, BMI, smoker, number of children and region.
* data: The medical insurance data
* med_insurance.ipynb: Some general data processing steps and a centralised model for medical insurance charge prediction
* med_insurance_federated.ipynb: The federated model for medical insurance charge prediction
